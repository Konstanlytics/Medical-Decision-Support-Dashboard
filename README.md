- Yearly and Monthly Visit Trends.

- Satisfaction Heatmap by Race and Age Group.

### Tools & Technologies
---

- Power BI for interactive visualizations
  
- Power Query for transformation

- DAX for calculated metrics and KPIs


#### 🩺 Use Case
---

- Hospitals and clinics can use this dashboard to:

- Plan better staff schedules during busy times to avoid delays.

- Make patients happier by cutting down long waiting times.

- See which departments are doing well and which ones need improvement.

- Understand what age groups or races are more satisfied.

- Track how patient visits are changing over time to spot trends.

- Compare weekday and weekend visits to adjust services accordingly.

- Find out how many patients are referred by departments and how often people come in without a referral.

##### 🛠️ Dashboard Design & Features
---

I built this dashboard using different types of charts like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to show the data clearly. I added filters (slicers) so users can click and explore the information easily. To keep everything looking neat, I used a matching color theme and made sure the layout is clean and organized. I also used conditional formatting to make important numbers stand out for example, to show when wait times are too high or satisfaction scores are low.
